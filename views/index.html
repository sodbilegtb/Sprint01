    <h1>Welcome to Web Technology!</h1>
    <p>Web technology refers to the means by which computers communicate with each other using markup languages and multimedia packages. It gives us the ability to communicate with hosted information, like websites, over the Internet.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With CSS and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to design HTML markup, for example changing colors, layouts, and fonts. It is essential to building visually attractive webpages.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
